<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="1">What is a Fraternity?</a></h4>

<p style="display: none;" id="1_a">A fraternity is a group of men who believe and live by the same set of values, and foster a close friendship through those values. Their shared values bind together not only the current chapter members, but members and alumni throughout the country.  Sigma Phi Epsilon's values are Virtue, Diligence, and Brotherly Love.</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="2">Why does SigEp pride itself on being "different"?</a></h4>
<div style="display: none;" id="2_a">
<p>SigEps refuse to be stereotyped as "frat boys," nor its chapters as "animal houses." Sigma Phi Epsilon is dedicated to the idea that a fraternity is much more than a social organization - it is an institution of higher learning; one that centers around the ideals of allowing a brother to live his best life.  SigEp does not tolerate hazing or pledging, rather, we have a brother development brother that encourages our brother development focuses on the continued growth of each brother throughout his time in the chapter.
</p>

<p>In addition, SigEp has blazed a trail for fraternities across the country.  SigEp was the first national fraternity to receive a grant from the federal Department of Education to enhance member development programs, first national fraternity to provide financial assistance to brothers for graduate school through the Resident Scholar program, and first national fraternity to partner with the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="3">My son is considering joining a SigEp chapter. What can I expect?</a></h4>
<div style="display: none;" id="3_a">
<p>When a young man joins Sigma Phi Epsilon, he immediately finds out he has joined something unique. In joining a Balanced Man Program chapter like ours, he instantly becomes a brother. The Balanced Man Program does away with the "pledge model" of the fraternity experience, and puts an emphasis on continued development throughout college and beyond.
</p>
<p>You should expect he will be involved in the chapter, on campus, and in the community. At Yale, we are all held to GPA standards, as well as standards for campus and chapter involvement. These standards aim to foster an environment through which we motivate one another to make the most of our college careers. By your son becoming a SigEp, he will be exposed to a life of balance and encouraged to pursue leadership roles.
</p></div>
<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="4">What is Sigma Phi Epsilon's stance on hazing?</a></h4>
<p style="display: none;" id="4_a">Sigma Phi Epsilon is clear and concise in its stance against hazing. Hazing is illegal and it has no place in the Fraternity. Sigma Phi Epsilon truly believes that the words "hazing" and "fraternity" are not interchangeable. SigEp has, for many years, been breaking the stereotype that fraternities haze. The National Fraternity, through programming and leadership opportunities, has promoted the idea of safe and responsible development.
</p>
<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="5">What is Sigma Phi Epsilon's perspective on alcohol and substance abuse?</a>
</h4>
<p style="display: none;" id="5_a">At SigEp, we go to great lengths to educate our new members on alcohol and its effects. Through the programming of both the University and our national headquarters, SigEp helps its members understand the consequences of one's choices when alcohol is involved. SigEp also promotes risk management guidelines to help chapters and members make smart decisions when it comes to alcohol.
</p>
<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="6">What is the Leadership Continuum?</a>
</h4>
<p style="display: none;" id="6_a">Sigma Phi Epsilon's Leadership Continuum is a balance of self-development and team leadership skills training composed in four programs: EDGE, the Carlson Leadership Academy, the Ruck Leadership Institute, and the Quest to Greece. Through self-discovery, analysis, and interaction, brothers develop skills necessary to lead balanced lives and to continue leading the fraternity world.
</p>
<h4><a href="#" class="faq" id="7">Who are some of SigEp's alumni, and what do they say about the SigEp experience?</a>
</h4>
<div style="display: none;" id="7_a">
<p>Sigma Phi Epsilon has a long tradition of alumni. These men excel in their respective fields. Among them are businessmen, world leaders, renowned artists, and all-star athletes.
</p>
<p>The greatest thing about SigEp alumni is they truly believe in the SigEp Experience. The proof is that our alumni continue to volunteer to help chapters and members. They continually donate money to the Sigma Phi Epsilon Educational Foundation for programs and scholarships. SigEp alumni believe that the SigEp experience is a lifetime commitment, and that is why they keep coming back to support the fraternity and its endeavors.
