<h4>ABOUT</h4>
<p> Our chapter makes a concerted effort to stay involved with the New Haven community and
beyond through several community service programs. This year, the brothers of Yale SigEp have
teamed up with Hunger Heroes to work weekly shifts at a local soup kitchen. The opportunity
presents a meaningful way for brothers to interact with New Haven residents and give back to
the community on a regular basis. This spring, the fraternity is organizing a SigEp-led military
care package initiative to assemble meaningful bundles of goods and mementos to stationed
troops overseas. This new effort will become a yearly tradition for the chapter, and hopes to
grow into a campus-wide project that connects SigEp with other groups at Yale. Lastly, this
semester the fraternity will partner with the Connecticut Alliance of Foster and Adoptive
Families to help support the group’s annual prom event in East Hartford for foster and adopted
youth.
<br /> <br />
In the past, we have held several events for charitable causes that the chapter supports. In the fall
of 2016, we opted to turn the annual Halloween party, Spook&#39;d, into a philanthropic event. We
paired with the Tommy Fund, a partner of the Yale-New Haven Hospital that combats childhood
cancer. We ended up donating all proceeds of the event to the Tommy Fund, ultimately donating
$2,500 to the organization. Last spring, the chapter partnered with Yale&#39;s Kappa Alpha Theta to
organize a Valentine&#39;s Day raffle to raise money for the Flint Clean Water Fund. We raised
$1,650, which helped provide 11 families in Flint, Michigan with clean drinking water during a
time of crisis. Finally, the fraternity has actively supported Camp Kesem – a national
organization that provides a summer camp experience for children with cancer-diagnosed parents
– by hosting a spring benefit concert and promoting the cause across campus.
<br /> <br />This coming spring (2017), we have several events in the works, including a potential benefit concert for Camp Kesem, a national organization that provides a summer camp for children with cancer-diagnosed parents. </p>
